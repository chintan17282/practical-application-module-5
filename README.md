## Introduction
#### Statement
This is project report of analysis done as part of Berkley HAAS ML/AI practical application in Module 5. 

#### Overview
The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

#### Approach 
There were many variables which were analyzed namely income, occupation, weather, time, marital status, co passengers and presence of children and their choice when they pickup coffee house,  carry away, and expensive or economic restaurants. 
-	Parameters like weather, time and occupation where individually analyzed to compare what is the coupon acceptance criteria for different coupon type.
-	In second part  analysis we picked up each coupon category and dissected it, what influence does income, occupation, marital status, co passengers and presence of children have on preference of that coupon type. Additionally Joint Probability of co-passengers with and without children were also tabulated. 
    This by no means is an exhaustive list but have tried to common cases that could influence the choice.
-	Attempt was made to highlight the difference between some of the coupon types to see the trend and influence.
